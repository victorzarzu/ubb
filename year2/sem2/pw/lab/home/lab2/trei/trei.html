                He was the son of actor James Henry Hackett (1800–1871). He attended Borland & Forrester Private Academy and Columbia College, and graduated from New York University in 1837. Then he studied law with Joshua N. Spencer in Utica, and from 1840 on with William M. Evarts and Jonathan Prescott Hall in New York City. He was admitted to the bar in 1842, and practiced in New York City. He married Laura Jane Hall (1825–1897), and their only child was Minnie Laura (Hackett) Trowbridge (1850–1914).

                In 1849, he went to San Francisco, California, and practiced law there in partnership with Eugene Casserly. Hackett was elected Corporation Counsel of San Francisco, and served one term.
                
                In 1857, he returned to New York City, and soon afterwards entered city politics being elected Secretary of Mozart Hall, the Anti-Tammany Hall Democratic organization founded by Fernando Wood. He was appointed by John E. Develin as Assistant Corporation Counsel of New York City. As such, in 1862, Hackett contested John Kelly's claim for $20,000 sheriff's fees, thus gaining Kelly's enmity.
                
                Hackett was still in office when Recorder John T. Hoffman took office as Mayor of New York City on January 1, 1866. To fill the vacancy proved difficult, the Board of Supervisors of New York County having six Republicans and six Democrats. On March 6, 1866, after more than two months of deadlock, Hackett was elected Recorder of New York City, and was elected to succeed himself for a full three-year term, running on the Tammany ticket in November 1866. In November 1869, he was re-elected on the Tammany ticket, the term having been extended to six years in the meanwhile. Hackett was responsible for doing some of the judicial bidding of ward chiefs. During a period that lasted almost 2 years, Hackett dismissed 170 court cases.[1] After succeeding William M. Tweed as boss of Tammany Hill, Kelly launched a personal attack on Hackett, and on October 12, 1875, had Frederick Smyth nominated for Recorder. The next day, Hackett was nominated on the Republican ticket, and then endorsed by the Anti-Tammany Democrats. Defeating Smyth, he was elected to a fourteen-year term, the term having been extended again, to match the duration of the term of the other judges and justices of the various courts in New York.
                
                In 1878, Hackett began to suffer from a prolonged illness, and spent a two-month-long summer vacation in Europe. Although at first slightly improving, his health deteriorated again, so that Hackett sat for the last time as judge on the bench of the Court of General Sessions on October 1, 1878. In August 1879, he caught a severe cold while on a hunting and fishing trip around Islip, Long Island, which evolved into bronchitis, pericarditis and dropsy. Five months later, he died at his residence, 72 Park Avenue (Manhattan), without having recovered his health. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx).
                
                The actor James Keteltas Hackett (1869–1926) was his half-brother. In 1914, James inherited the larger part of the estate, valued at $1,389,049.46, from his niece Minnie who aged 57 had married Francis Emory Trowbridge (1845–1910), and died without issue.

                DE 92 begins at the intersection with DE 100 and Adams Dam Road near Montchanin. The route runs northeast on two-lane undivided Thompson Bridge Road, crossing Wilson Run and passing through farmland to the north of Brandywine Creek State Park. The road continues into forested areas of the state park, crossing the Brandywine Creek. After the state park, DE 92 heads into areas of fields and woods within the Brandywine Valley section of First State National Historical Park, leaving the park and continuing northeast along Ramsey Road before curving to the north. The route turns east onto Beaver Valley Road, widening into a four-lane divided highway as it passes south of business parks and north of the Brandywine Campus of Wilmington University before it intersects US 202 in Brandywine.[3][4]

Past the US 202 intersection, DE 92 becomes Naamans Road and passes to the south of the Brandywine Town Center shopping center, where a park and ride lot is located, as it continues into residential and commercial areas and intersects Shipley Road. Past the Brandywine Town Center, the route heads through neighborhoods in Brandywine Hundred and has a junction with Grubb Road before it runs to the south of Concord High School and intersects Ebright Road, which goes north to Ebright Azimuth (the highest point in Delaware) and into Pennsylvania. After this, the road comes to an intersection with DE 261 in Ways Corner.[3][4]

Farther east, DE 92 reaches a junction with the northern terminus of DE 3 in Hanbys Corner. Past the Darley Road intersection, the route passes north of a church that is home to a park and ride lot. From here, the road intersects Carpenter Station Road in Carpenter, where there is a park and ride lot on the southeast corner, before it crosses over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line on a bridge and turns to the east-southeast. The route heads into business areas in Claymont and comes to a diamond interchange with I-95 at the northern terminus of I-495; the southbound exit at this interchange is from I-495 while the other ramps connect directly with I-95. After the I-95 interchange, DE 92 passes to the south of the Tri-State Mall and crosses Naamans Creek before it has a westbound right-in/right-out intersection with the southern terminus of DE 491. Past this intersection, the route turns southeast and has a junction with Ridge Road before ending at US 13 south of the Robinson House.[3][4]

DE 92 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 30,848 vehicles at the Harvey Road intersection to a low of 6,643 vehicles at the Creek Road intersection.[1] The portion of DE 92 east of US 202 is part of the National Highway System.[5]

                The Leyland Tiger was released in 1981. Initially, only one engine was offered, the turbocharged Leyland TL11, which could be rated up to 260 hp. The Leopard had enjoyed huge success as a bus in Scotland, usually with the Alexander Y-type body, but had lost some Scottish Bus Group orders to Seddon's Pennine 7, owing to Leyland's unwillingness to offer a Gardner engine in the Leopard.

When Leyland launched the Tiger, it continued this same unwillingness, just as Dennis was developing the Gardner-engined Dennis Dorchester, which similarly had the potential to win Scottish Bus Group orders away from the Tiger. Faced with this possibility, Leyland offered Gardner 6HLX-series engines in the Tiger from 1984.[6] To facilitate this, the Tiger chassis had to be modified, as the Gardner engine was significantly larger than the TL11. Although the threat from the Dorchester was successfully warded off, there proved to be a limited market for the Gardner-engined Tiger outside of Scottish Bus Group.

A North American engine, the Cummins L10, was also made an option by 1987.[7][8] The Cummins engine was being specified more often from around 1988, and with this engine, the gearbox would usually be a ZF as opposed to the Leyland Hydracyclic.

Volvo took over Leyland in 1988, and from 1989 the Tiger was offered with the Volvo THD100-series engine (as fitted in the best-selling B10M). The large majority of Volvo-engined Tigers went to Northern Ireland. At around this time, the TL11 and Gardner options were dropped, leaving only the Cummins and Volvo options available.[9][10][11]

                When Hugo Chávez took office in early 1999, Salazar was among the most prestigious, young officers chosen to serve as one Chávez's honor guards.[2] Salazar then not only provided security for Chávez, but was also his personal assistant.[2] Following the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt, Chávez recognized Salazar as one of his defenders.[1]

Following his experiences during the coup attempt in 2002, Salazar then decided to join Venezuela's special forces.[1] After a helicopter demonstration performed by Salazar at the Parade of the Navy in 2006, Chávez once again recognized Salazar and asked Jesse Chacón, then Minister of Interior and Justice, to place Salazar on his security details for a second time at Miraflores Palace.[1] Salazar was then reassigned and provided security for Chávez until 2013, when Chávez died of cancer.[1]
